The run_analysis script performs data merging and filtereing on a dataset from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
and produces the tidyDataSet.txt file which gives a data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Explinations of the script can be found in the comments in the run_analysis found in this repo.

The CodeBook.md file found in this repository explains the data found in the data

*Please not the run_analysis script needs the dplyr packages installed and loaded.
